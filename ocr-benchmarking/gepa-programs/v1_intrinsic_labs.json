      "instructions": "Convert the provided document image to Markdown. Return only the Markdown with no explanation text.\n\nRules\n1) Coverage and reading order\n   - Include everything visible: titles, headings, subheadings, headers\/footers, page numbers, body text, labels and field values, notes\/disclaimers, legends\/captions, axis titles, stamps, logos (visible text only), watermarks (visible text only), and any text embedded in charts\/graphs\/infographics.\n   - Preserve the original reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). Keep related content together and place captions\/headings immediately before their figures.\n   - Do not omit or invent any content.\n\n2) Headings and hierarchy\n   - Render the main document\/page title as H1 (# …) exactly as printed.\n   - Use H2\/H3 (##, ###) for subordinate section labels according to visual prominence (e.g., From, To, Filing Status, Digital assets, Income, Transactions by Quarter).\n   - Keep heading text exactly as shown (punctuation, casing, typos unchanged).\n   - Separate logical blocks (headings, paragraphs, tables, figures) with a single blank line.\n\n3) Text blocks, labels, and line breaks\n   - Preserve meaningful line breaks. Do not arbitrarily merge or split lines.\n   - Keep each labeled field on its own line unless the source prints multiple labels\/values on the same line (e.g., “Date: …  Project: …” only if shown that way).\n   - Preserve punctuation, casing, hyphenation, and spacing exactly as printed.\n   - Preserve typographic emphasis that conveys structure: use Markdown bold\/italic only when clearly present in the source (e.g., emphasized section names or field labels). Do not invent emphasis.\n\n4) Tables\n   - Use a Markdown table for standard tabular data with clear columns\/rows.\n   - Use HTML <table> only when needed to preserve structure not supported by Markdown tables (e.g., multi-line content within a cell, merged cells\/colspan\/rowspan, nested tables). When using HTML tables:\n     - Include <thead> and <tbody>, use <th> for header cells and <td> for data cells.\n     - Escape special characters inside HTML (& to &amp;, < to &lt;, > to &gt;).\n     - For multi-line cell content, insert a single <br> per printed line break.\n   - Do not convert simple form layouts (label\/value lines or boxed fields) into tables. Transcribe those as labeled lines.\n   - Preserve column order, header labels, and units exactly as printed. Do not add, remove, or rename columns.\n   - If a cell is blank in the image, output an empty cell (in HTML: <td><\/td>; in Markdown: leave the cell empty).\n\n5) Numbers and units\n   - Copy values exactly, including currency symbols, thousands separators, decimal precision, signs, ranges, units, abbreviations (e.g., R, $M, %), and degree symbols. Do not round, compute, normalize, or infer missing digits.\n\n6) Charts, graphs, and infographics\n   - Add one concise, factual alt-text line using Markdown image syntax without a URL: ![Short description]. Do not include a placeholder URL (e.g., avoid (null)).\n   - Use neutral descriptions (e.g., “Bar chart showing Transactions by Quarter”). Mention axis titles only if they add information not otherwise captured.\n   - If explicit, readable categories\/series and values are present (from labels, data markers, axis labels, or legend), also include a data table listing the data.\n     - Use the printed variable names and units as column headers (e.g., “Transaction Amount ($M)”).\n     - Use the category names exactly as printed (e.g., legend labels). Never substitute color names (“Green\/Blue”) for categories; if a category name is unclear, use unreadable.\n     - If any value\/label is unclear, write unreadable for that item.\n   - Do not list axis tick labels separately if the same information is captured in the data table.\n\n7) Logos, watermarks, stamps, and page numbers\n   - Transcribe visible text exactly as printed. Do not wrap in custom tags or add graphic descriptions beyond the visible text.\n   - Page numbers must be transcribed exactly as shown (including spaces\/separators) and placed where they appear in the page flow (typically at the end).\n\n8) Checkboxes\n   - Render unchecked as ☐ and checked as ☑. Keep each checkbox adjacent to its label and preserve line breaks\/indents as printed.\n   - Do not convert checkbox groups into tables unless the original is tabular.\n\n9) Unreadable or ambiguous content\n   - Do not guess. If characters or text are illegible, write unreadable in place of the unclear portion (e.g., “947 unreadable 3542”).\n   - Use unknown only when the presence\/role is clear but the specific identity is not provided (e.g., an unlabeled entity that is clearly present but has no readable text).\n   - For ambiguous characters (0\/O, 1\/I\/l) or partially obscured text, prefer unreadable rather than guessing. If an entire region is obscured, mark the whole item as unreadable.\n\n10) Consistency and formatting\n   - Use a single coherent style across the page(s): Markdown for headings and paragraphs; Markdown tables by default; HTML tables only when necessary (see Rule 4); concise alt text for non-text visuals.\n   - Preserve meaningful line breaks and ordering. Do not transform plain text into lists unless bullets or numbering are explicitly shown.\n   - When using Markdown tables, escape pipes inside cell text as \\|. In plain text, escape Markdown special characters when needed to preserve the literal text (e.g., underscores in email addresses).\n\n11) Prohibitions\n   - Do not add explanations, commentary, or metadata.\n   - Do not include code fences or embed images\/binary\/base64 data.\n   - Do not correct spelling, grammar, or formatting from the source.\n   - Do not infer, compute, or fabricate content.",
